Example 2 – model should predict ckd
Use these values:

Age: 65

Blood Pressure (BP): 100

Specific Gravity (SG): 1.010

Albumin (AL): 3

Sugar (SU): 2

Hypertension (htn): Yes

Diabetes (dm): Yes


Age = 65
Older age is a strong risk factor for chronic kidney disease because kidney function naturally declines with age and chronic conditions (hypertension, diabetes) are more common.​

Many CKD datasets (including yours) have a higher proportion of CKD cases in patients above 60.

Blood Pressure (BP) = 100 (high)
Here BP is 100 mmHg diastolic or high overall, indicating hypertension.

Long‑term high blood pressure damages the small blood vessels in the kidneys, reducing filtration and leading to CKD.​

Specific Gravity (SG) = 1.010 (low/iso‑sthenuric)
Normal urine specific gravity is roughly 1.015–1.025; 1.010 is low and close to plasma (“isosthenuric”).

Low SG means kidneys cannot concentrate urine properly, which is typical in CKD where nephron function is reduced.​

Albumin (AL) = 3 (protein in urine)
Albumin describes protein (albumin) found in urine; value 3 corresponds to significant proteinuria in this dataset.

Protein leakage into urine is a hallmark of kidney damage and is used clinically to diagnose and stage CKD.​

Sugar (SU) = 2 (glucose in urine)
Presence of sugar in urine suggests poor blood sugar control.

Persistent hyperglycemia (as in diabetes) damages kidney blood vessels over time, leading to diabetic nephropathy, a very common cause of CKD.​

Hypertension (htn) = Yes
Indicates the patient has diagnosed high blood pressure.

Hypertension is both a cause and a consequence of CKD; models treat “htn = yes” as a strong indicator of kidney disease risk

Diabetes (dm) = Yes
Indicates the patient has diabetes mellitus.

Diabetes is the leading cause of CKD worldwide; combining “dm = yes” with albumin in urine and low SG strongly points toward CKD in clinical practice and in prediction models.​
